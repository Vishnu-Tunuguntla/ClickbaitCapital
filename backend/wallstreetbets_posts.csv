# With Apple Intelligence coming to consumers later this year, I think VZ is ready to break out. It's been trading cheap over the past 12 months largely due to EPA/Lead worries and other economic risks. Despite this, major iPhone enhancements/upgrades historically led to significant VZ gains.

# Factors to Consider

1. **Historical Impact of iPhone Upgrade Cycles**: Historically, major iPhone releases have led to increased sales and activations for telecom companies. For example, previous upgrade cycles have seen spikes in new customer acquisitions and higher data plan sales.
2. **5G Expansion**: Verizon‚Äôs ongoing investment in 5G technology is likely to align well with new iPhone models, especially if they leverage advanced 5G capabilities. This could lead to higher customer demand for Verizon's 5G services.
3. **Market Trends and Analyst Forecasts**: Current analyst forecasts project Verizon‚Äôs stock to have an average price target of $43.8 in the next 12 months without factoring in a new iPhone cycle‚Äã ([Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/vz/forecast/))‚Äã.

# Estimating the Impact

To estimate the potential impact of an iPhone upgrade cycle, we can look at the effect of previous major upgrades on Verizon's stock price and adjust current projections accordingly. Let's assume a 5-10% positive impact based on historical data and the increased demand for 5G services.

Verizon's stock price should reach **$55-60** in 12 months. This estimation is based on historical impacts of iPhone releases, current market conditions, and the assumption that the upgrade cycle would have a positive effect similar to past cycles. Plus, don't forget, you're getting a nice divi every quarter while you wait for the iPhone pop."
ATM deep EXP calls,"Im kind of new when it comes to trading with options although I have got my feet a little wet over the years but definitely a very seasoned stock trader. What I have began to wonder more as I have researched more and came to understand more about options is why not just buy deep expiration ITM or ATM calls on Index Funds and ETFs like SPY, VTI and QQQ. I understand theta would render an issue when it comes to low market volatality especially in these sectors but in reality, the index' and ETF' space always does profit even if it at a slow pace compared to prev month. anyway im just looking for insight as I continue to learn more about options and outleveraging myself into piss."
Micron!!!,I‚Äôm running 3 $110 strike price 7/19 calls let me know if your hoping on puts or calls and what you think of micron. 
$Phat DD,"feeling bullish on PHAT, it‚Äôs got an uptrend going, increased volatility lately with a general bullish side, according to value investing its intrinsic value is 6-7x its current value, and all price targets i can find are above $20

What people are missing about NVDA,"I‚Äôve been reading NVDA ever since they purchased 3DFX - which means before many of you were even alive.

No one can ever catch up to nvidia. They have the most advanced chips, and because they‚Äôre already using AI to help them design next generation chips, no matter what, they will ALWAYS be massively ahead of the competition. 

They own the supply, so even if a competitor started to purchase nvidia Blackwell cluster, nvidia could just control the amount they sell to said competitor. The simple fact is this: they won and scaling laws say they will always win.

Anyone who thinks or says ‚Äúcompetitors will catch up‚Äù is a moron, and you should run far, far away from them."
MARA stock?,Marathon Digital Holdings looks freakishly bullish. The volume on this stock is unreal. With 90% of analysts saying to buy and hold. The CEO is very approved and earnings seem to be constantly going up. I bought. What do y‚Äôall think?
I will sell these HIMS calls when I stop seeing fat people on the streets of America,"TL;DR - Boner pills good. Weight loss pills good. Hair loss pills good. Ozempic/GLP1/longevity narrative good. Upside in valuation good. 

DD: 

They‚Äôve been crushing earnings because their zoomer/millenial customers will look past high margins (for quick personalized healthcare over an app instead of a phone call or IRL). FDA shortage <> compound loophole should allow them to grow their base for the next year or more.

Hoping the high marketing spend YTD combined with their new weight loss pills _not_ being included in guidance (before august earnings) will let me print on these. 

Eli Lilly at ATH and potentially splitting stock/crossing 1T$ should have people scrambling for healthcare/ozempic adjacent exposure? Their potential to extend offerings to things like sleep/testosterone/other GLP1 drugs are other catalysts imo. 

> but much side effects and long term impact 

Go yell that outside the Coca Cola HQ too. 

Ozempic (and other drugs) will reach mainstream escape velocity whether you like it or not. Just like Botox and other procedures: Celebrities => Yuppies/IG thots in big cities who want to be like Celebrities => Affluent suburban moms (we are here) => Everyone who is currently obese. 

I bulleive in the boner pill company and have the risk appetite

Am I doing this wrong?,"Am I wrong? 

Suppose inflation rekindles. 

If JPOW doesn‚Äôt raise rates we get more inflation

If JPOW raises rates our already large debt payments get bigger, we can‚Äôt pay all the interest without more taxes and cutbacks, which likely won‚Äôt happen, so we print money to pay off the interest payments, causing more inflation

So if inflation makes a comeback all roads lead to more inflation?

Best case for Netflix,"Netflix is the undisputed leader in tvod. While they have struggled significantly to diversify their product, they have added more live content, and maintained the ability to entertain audiences and increase subscribers. The company faces fierce competition, but through a combination of IP and good tech, as well as a very strong brand, they remain the industry leader. Still, the tvod sector has various existential challenges such as microinfluencer content. However, the company is trading at nearly its most bullish levels ever, nearly at the height of their value in the post Covid craze. Following which, the stock experience a tumultuous collapse, going from roughly 690 to 180 in share value (I bought shares during this time). The company rose again, in part because they continued successful global expansion, and retained customers far better than other tvod platforms. The stewardship of Netflix has been strong, and there‚Äôs still room for international growth, but perhaps not tons of room. I‚Äôm however more concerned about Netflix in a macroeconomic perspective. Dragging interest rates with no end in sight could lead to another market panic. Netflix, both as a stock and company, would like suffer significantly as they did in the prior bear market. Their long term puts are priced as low as they‚Äôve been, as the stock has done nothing but rise. I‚Äôm getting nervous that their buy pressure may soon disappear. My general thesis is that long term options are impossible to price, and as such the market automation will get these wrong the most. Thats been my most successful thesis in my personal investing. In this case, I feel once again that the market is refusing to acknowledge the significant risk of Netflix experiencing a precipitous drop within the next year, which can be triggered by many competitive and macroeconomic factors. Given the historically low cost of these options, they can serve as both insurance against a market fall, a flip for a small drop in Netflix price, and ultimately an asymmetric wager on the next year in the market."
